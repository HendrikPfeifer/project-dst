The colour sorting was done according to the primary_group. Since the density of the squares was reduced, it is easy to see in which districts the most crimes took place.

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "With the help of our analysis, the important questions \"Which kind of crimes happen particularly frequently and where/when do they happen?\" could be clarified in order to answer the question of \"Where the new Crime Prevention Centers should be built in Chicago?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We have learned that the crime types vary in frequency. For example, the offences \"theft\" and \"assault_and_battery\" account for over 50% of all registered cases. Other crimes such as \"sexual_crime\" or \"homicide\" are (fortunately) much less common. But we also found out that most of the crimes occur during the day, between 9pm and 7pm. The course of the line shows how crimes also adapt to people's daily rhythms. Of course, we were also able to get an overview of which districts of Chicago have the most crimes and how serious they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data show that there are particular hot spots in the city. These are located around the city center in district 1, where a particularly high number of (lighter) crimes of \"group_1\" occur. In the outer areas of the city, e.g. in and around district 11 and districts 6 and 8, there is an increase in (more serious) crimes of \"group_2\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the data situation (2018 and 2019), we were unable to determine a trend as to whether there will be fewer or more crimes over time. To determine this, we would need to analyse data of an even longer period of time.\n",
    "One limitation of our analysis is that we were not able to work very statistically. This is mainly due to the fact that the data are mostly categorical. The observations allow us to find out where, when and which crime took place, but not who and why the crime was committed. Also, were not able to statistically verify the two hypotheses. This would have to be done better in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, it was not easy at the beginning to summarize the more than 40 different types of offenses in a meaningful way. As a result, the individual offenses may not always be accurately reflected in our analysis.\n",
    "Also, a grouping according to three different severity rates is rather subjective and may vary from viewer to viewer.\n",
    "\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "attachments": {},
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Recommended action\n",
    "\n",
    "We can clearly see that Chicago is a violent city and that the city council needs to react to prevent or lower these in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore we suggest Crime Prevention Centers in the districts. We understand that it is to expensive to open them in every district. Considering our analysis and graphs we would open at least 5 Centers in the most violent districts with focus on special crime types/groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  District 11 (5432 incidents) - focus on \"narcotics\" and general \"group_2\". \n",
    "2.  District 6 (4712) - focus on \"criminal damage\" and general \"group_2\".\n",
    "3.  District 8 (4591) - focus on \"criminal damage\" and general \"group_2\".\n",
    "4.  District 1 (4560) - focus on \"theft\" and \"deceptive practice\" and general \"group_1\".\n",
    "5.  District 18 (4485) - focus on \"theft\" and \"deceptive practice\" and generals \"group_1\".\n",
    "\n",
    "It also makes sense to open the Crime Prevention Centers in certain streets, as there are some very violent streets. Most of these streets are going through 2 or more districts, like the State Street or Michigan Avenue, which are the most violent streets in Chicago.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also understand that the Prevention Centers can't be open 24 hours a day, so we would adapt their opening hours to the time when the most crime happen statisticly. We would suggest opening times at least from 11am to 8 pm because this are the most violent hours, especially around 12pm and 7 pm. The 5 most violent hours are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  12pm   (4663 incidents)\n",
    "2.  7pm    (4413)\n",
    "3.  6pm    (4383)\n",
    "4.  3pm    (4226)\n",
    "5.  5pm    (4225)\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the months over the year, we would still recommend to keep the Prevention Center open the whole year, because there are no months with a significant decrease of crime.\n",
