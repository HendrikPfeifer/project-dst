    "### Subject Matter:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the city of Chicago, many incidents/crimes happen every day, from minor thefts to murders. To reduce the violence in the city, the city wants to open a new crime prevention centre. Now the city is asking our team which crimes occur particularly frequently and where they happen. With this information, the **Crime Prevention Center** can be built in a particularly well-situated location. In addition, the specialised departments of the centre can be trained for the relevant criminal offences. This should make Chicago a safer city and ensure that measures are taken at an early stage to prevent crime. Therefore we would like to analyse where and when it makes the most sense to open the Crime Prevention Center to gain the most success.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation:\n",
    "Parts of Chicago are one of the most violent and dangerous neighborhoods in the United States. We would like to help the city to prevent some crimes in the future and let Chicago live up to its potential!\n",
    "\n",
    "Various studies show that it is possible to prevent crime in cities with the help of specific actions. With the new **Crime Prevention Center**, we want to take a new approach in Chicago to prevent crime from the very beginning.\n",

    "\n",
    "### General Question:\n",
    "\n",
    "Which kind of crimes happen particularly frequently and where/when do they happen?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are neighborhoods in Chicago where the most (dangerous) crimes/incidents occur.\n",
    "There is a certain time of a day when the most crime occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** As there were many unnecessary observations, we dropped these to keep our dataset as clean as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Date** Date when the incident occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Block**\tThe partially redacted address where the incident occurred, placing it on the same block as the actual address.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Primary Type** The primary description of the IUCR code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Arrest** Indicates whether an arrest was made.\t\n",
    "\t\n",
    "* **District** Indicates the police district where the incident occurred. See the districts at https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/fthy-xz3r.\t\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Year** Year the incident occurred.\t\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Latitude** The longitude of the location where the incident occurred. This location is shifted from the actual location for partial redaction but falls on the same block.\t\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Longitude** The longitude of the location where the incident occurred. This location is shifted from the actual location for partial redaction but falls on the same block.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **month** Month the incident occured\n",
    "\n",
    "* **hour** Hour the incident occured\n",
    "\n",
    "* **primary_group** We decided to combine the primary types into 3 groups: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Group_1: light to medium crimes\n",
    "- Group_2: medium to serious crimes\n",
    "- Group_3: homicide/murder\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the data was collected:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** As the original dataset was too large, we have reduced it a little, so it only contains criminal cases from 2018 and 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crimes - 2001 to Present\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the most recent seven days. Data is extracted from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. In order to protect the privacy of crime victims, addresses are shown at the block level only and specific locations are not identified.

    "### EDA\n",
    "\n",
    "The following section contains the EDA. Most of the data preparation and cleaning of the raw data was done separately.\n",
    "- Data transformation and handling missing values. \n",
    "- Unnecessary observations and variables were deleted.\n",
    "- The variable \"date\" was converted into \"month\", \"hour\" and \"days\". \n",
    "- The original 33 \"primary_type\" variables were converted into 10 \"primary_type\" variables and being renamed.\n",
    "- Creation of smaller datasets.\n",
    "- Preparation of the map-dataset for visualisation.\n",

The colour sorting was done according to the primary_group. Since the density of the squares was reduced, it is easy to see in which districts the most crimes took place. It is also possible to filter according to one of the three individual primary_group. The map allows the viewer to quickly get an overview of the local frequency and degree of the crimes.\n",

It is important for us to know at what time the crimes were committed in order to adapt the opening hours of the Crime Prevention Center to the local conditions.\n",
