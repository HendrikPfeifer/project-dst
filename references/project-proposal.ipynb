    "\n",
    "In the city of Chicago, many crimes happen every day, from minor thefts to murders. To reduce the violence in the city, the city wants to open a new crime prevention centre. Now the city is asking our team which crimes occur particularly frequently and where they happen. With this information, the **Crime Prevention Center** can be built in a particularly well-situated location. In addition, the specialised departments of the centre can be trained for the relevant criminal offences. This should make Chicago a safer city and ensure that measures are taken at an early stage to prevent crime.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Various studies show that it is possible to prevent crime in cities with the help of specific actions. With the new **Crime Prevention Center**, we want to take a new approach in Chicago to prevent crime from the very beginning.\n",
