    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "*This section includes an introduction to the project motivation, data, and research question. Include a data dictionary* \n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the city of Chicago, many incidents/crimes happen every day, from minor thefts to murders. To reduce the violence in the city, the city wants to open a new crime prevention centre. Now the city is asking our team which crimes occur particularly frequently and where they happen. With this information, the **Crime Prevention Center** can be built in a particularly well-situated location. In addition, the specialised departments of the centre can be trained for the relevant criminal offences. This should make Chicago a safer city and ensure that measures are taken at an early stage to prevent crime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Various studies show that it is possible to prevent crime in cities with the help of specific actions. With the new **Crime Prevention Center**, we want to take a new approach in Chicago to prevent crime from the very beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Which kind of crimes happen particularly frequently and where do they happen?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "There are places (districts/blocks) in Chicago where the most (dangerous) crimes/incidents happen.\n",
