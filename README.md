## Chicago Crime Prevention Center Project



---

### Project description

In the city of Chicago, many incidents/crimes happen every day, from minor thefts to murders. To reduce the violence in the city, the city wants to open new crime prevention centers. Now the city is asking our team which crimes occur particularly frequently,  where and when do they happen. With this information, the **Crime Prevention Centers** can be built in particularly well-situated locations. In addition, the specialised departments of the center can be trained for the relevant criminal offences. This should make Chicago a safer city and ensure that measures are taken at an early stage to prevent crime. Therefore we would like to analyse where and when it makes the most sense to open the Crime Prevention Centers to gain the most success.
